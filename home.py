        <h3>Streamlit Connections Hackathon: Building Connections for MongoDB</h3>

        <p>Are you tired of the hassle and complexity of setting up data connections for your Streamlit apps? Look no further! The Streamlit Connections Hackathon is here to empower developers like you with the tools to connect your apps seamlessly to various data sources. We are excited to announce that our recent release of <code>st.experimental_connection</code> has made data integration easier than ever before!</p>

        <p>The Streamlit Connections Hackathon aims to explore the vast possibilities of <code>st.experimental_connection</code> and to encourage developers to build new connections for different data sources and APIs. The focus of this write-up will be on developing a connection for MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database.</p>

        <h4>MongoDB Connection: Empowering Streamlit Apps</h4>
        <p>MongoDB is a powerful and flexible NoSQL database that allows for the storage of unstructured data in JSON-like documents. It's widely used in modern web applications and data-driven projects due to its scalability and ease of use. By developing a MongoDB connection for Streamlit, we enable developers to seamlessly integrate MongoDB into their apps, harnessing its capabilities for data storage and retrieval.</p>
